## About WebRTC Native Client Momo

Momo is a WebRTC Native Client that uses "libwebrtc" and runs on various browser-less devices.
When Momo runs on Jetson Nano, it is possible to deliver 4K video compressed with H.264 to the browser within 1 second.

## Use "test mode"

First, try "test mode", where Momo itself has a function as a signaling server.

```shell
$ ./momo --no-audio-device --port 8080 test
```

If momo's IP address is 192.0.2.100, access the following URL and try to connect from WebRTC-compatible browser.

http://192.0.2.100:8080/html/test

## Use "Ayame mode"

"Ayame Labo" is a free signaling server service.

The room ID is "open-momo-en" in the sample, but it is recommended to use an ID that is difficult to guess.

```shell
$ ./momo --no-audio-device ayame wss://ayame-labo.shiguredo.jp/signaling open-momo-en
```

Check with the online sample of Ayame Web SDK.
Access by specifying the room ID in the URL argument.

```
